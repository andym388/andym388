### My Projects üëç

<img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black&style=for-the-badge" />

<b>‚òÖ Team Profile App</b><br>
This simple Team Profile App displays the information about your Team Members such as their name, job and a photo image.<br>
When your mouse hover over the trash icon, it turns red.<br>
When you click on the trash icon beside each profile, it removes that person's profile from the list of profiles.<br>
The Team Profile Data is stored as a JSON array having objects, so if you refresh the page, it will get the data back and repopulate the page with the profiles.<br>
Search functionality is also available such that when you type out some Search Characters, it filters and display the matching Names.<br>

Github Site: <a href="https://andym388.github.io/a02_1team-profile/">Team Profile Page</a><br>

<b>‚òÖ Weather Wizard</b><br>
Weather Wizard uses the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> to fetch weather data.<br>
When you enter in thw name of a city, the app will fetch and display the weather data for that city.<br>
When loading weather data is occurring, an interim message will be displayed.<br>
When the weather app encounter issues, handle the error event so that the processing will be terminated by throwing a proper error message.<br>
