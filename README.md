### My Projects ðŸ¤ž

<b>Hello World App</b><br>
The Hello World App is a time-honored tradition and simple exercise in computer programming to get started when learning something new.<br>
Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andym388/a01_1hello-world">Source code for this React App</a><br>
Github Site: <a href="https://andym388.github.io/a01_1hello-world/">Hello World Page</a><br>

<b>Team Profile App</b><br>
This simple Team Profile App displays the information about your Team Members such as the name, the job and a photo image.<br>
When your mouse hover over the trash icon, it turns red.<br>
When you click on the trash icon beside each profile, it removes that person's profile from the list of profiles.<br>
The Team Profile Data is stored as a JSON array having objects, so if you refresh the page, it will get the data back and repopulate the page with the profiles.<br>
Search functionality is also available such that when you type out some Search Characters, it filters and display the matching Names.<br>

<b>Weather Wizard</b><br>
Weather Wizard uses the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> to fetch weather data.<br>
When you can enter in a city, the app will fetch and display the weather data for that city.<br>
When loading weather data is occurring, a message will be displayed.<br>
When the loading of weather data encounter issues, catch the error event and throw a proper error message so that the App will not crash the web and return nasty, technical messages.<br>
