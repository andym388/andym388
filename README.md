### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page üëã

My hobby is to continously upgrade my home computer hardware, O/S and networking environment for experimentation with virtualisation, networking, security, databases, software development and catching up on latest technology trends for improving business outcomes.<br>

- ü§û In the 1st 6-12 months, I have acquired a basic understanding of the skill requirements to be a web developer using tutorials and projects available from YouTube.
- ‚öóÔ∏è In the coming 6-12 months, I wiil delve into more Advanced topics and build projects with Redux, React Router and Material UI. I will also attempt to learn about developing Cloud-based Microservices App using NodeJS, React and Docker.
- ‚ú® I will showcase my projects and coding journey here in GitHub and it will be accessible from my LinkedIn profile.

### My Projects üëç

<img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black&style=for-the-badge" />

<b>‚òÖ Team Profile App</b><br>
This simple Team Profile App displays the information about your Team Members such as their name, job and a photo image.<br>
When your mouse hover over the trash icon, it turns red.<br>
When you click on the trash icon beside each profile, it removes that person's profile from the list of profiles.<br>
The Team Profile Data is stored as a JSON array having objects, so if you refresh the page, it will get the data back and repopulate the page with the profiles.<br>
Search functionality is also available such that when you type out some Search Characters, it filters and display the matching Names.<br>
Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andym388/a02_1team-profile">Source code for this React App</a><br>
Github Site: <a href="https://andym388.github.io/a02_1team-profile/">Team Profile Page</a><br>

<b>‚òÖ Weather Wizard</b><br>
Weather Wizard is a single-page web App that uses the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> to fetch weather data.<br>
It can be deployed and hosted on a static website such as GitHub Page.<br>
When you enter in the name of a city, the app will fetch and display the weather data for that city.<br>
When the weather app encounter an error event, an error message will be displayed.<br>
When loading of weather data is occurring, an interim message will be displayed.<br>
When temperature is above 15¬∫C, a warm weather background will be displayed.<br>

<b>‚òÖ Weather Node</b><br>
The React Weaher App above is re-written in Node.js so that we can compare their differences in approach which are:<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Node.js App is a server-side App with access to the O/S, databases, file system and everything else to build a fully-functional App.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Hence, it needs to be hosted on a full-stack hosting service such as Railway and Render.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è A HTTP request is used to obtain the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap Database.<br>
‚ñ∂Ô∏è In contract, the React App is a client-side App that just obtain the weather data via an API call and then display the data onto the browser.<br>
