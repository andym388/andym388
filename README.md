Currently, I am focusing on acquiring the above skillsets.
- 🤞 In the 1st 6-12 months, I have acquired the basic skills needed to be a web developer using tutorials and projects available from YouTube.
- ⚗️ In the coming 6-12 months, I wiil delve into more Advanced topics using modern MERN full Stack, Redux, Material UI and Docker with the aim to develop Cloud-based Microservices. I will also be researching into AI Automation using OpenAI/ChatGPT and AI assisted coding in Visual Studio Code.
- ✨ I will showcase my projects and coding journey here in GitHub and it will be accessible from my LinkedIn profile.

### My Projects 💡🔥💥🚀🏁💰👍

<img alt="React" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black&style=for-the-badge" />

<b>⭐ My Team Profile</b><br>
My Team Profile is a simple, front-end browser App for beginners to pick up basic skills on React quickly.<br>
This App displays the information about my Team Members such as their name, job and a photo image.<br>
When your mouse hover over the trash icon, it turns red.<br>
When you click on the trash icon beside each profile, it removes that person's profile from the list of profiles.<br>
The Team Profile Data is provided as a JSON array having team member objects. When you refresh the page, the App will get the data back and repopulate the page.<br>
Search functionality is also available such that when you type out some Search Characters, it filters and display the matching Names instantly.<br>

<b>⭐ My Meal Planner</b><br>
My Meal Planner is a front-end browser App that uses the 👉🏼 <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a> to fetch Recipe data and Daily Meal Plans.<br>
The App consist of the following styled components:<br>
✅ Parts (or renders) such as Home Navigation Bar, Meal Type Selector, Cuisine Dropdown List, Search Forms and MealDaily Form that appear on the top of the  page.<br>
✅ Result Pages that are Route Components of the React Router. Result Pages are rendered from the Parts<br>
When you click on each Part, the URL in the browser changes; only the Result Page content is changed instead of altering the entire web page.<br>
When you click on the Home Navigation Bar, the Home Page with Random and Veggie recipes will be displayed as a Carousel Slider for the 1st 10 recipes found. The Home Page will always be loaded successfully even when the API Key Access is unavailable because the Recipe Data are saved in Local Storage.<br>
When you click on the Meal Type Selector Icon, the Meals Page will be displayed as a Data Grid.<br>
When you select a Cuisine Type from the Dropdown List, the Cuisines Page will be displayed as a Data Grid.<br>

<b>⭐ Weather Node</b><br>
The frontend React Weather Wizard App above is re-written using the NodeJS runtime and the ExpressJS framework.<br>
The differences in approach are:<br>
▶️ This Weather Node App will be a backend, server-side App that accesses the O/S, databases, file system and other system resources as a fully-functional App.<br>
▶️ Hence, it needs to be hosted on a full-stack hosting service such as Render to process the incoming, server-side HTTPS request for Data from the NodeJS App or Web Service.<br>
▶️ In contract, the React Weather Wizard App is a frontend, client-side App that access the Weather API from the browser to obtain/display the weather data.<br>

► Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andym388/b03_1weather-node">Source code for this NodeJS App</a><br>

<b>⭐ MERN Meal Planner</b><br>
This full-stack MERN App comes with User Authentication. Password hashing ensures that users login credentials are secure.<br> 
Additionally, the App uses token to provide a more secure authentication process for login and adding/saving of recipes.<br>
Users will be able to create an account, log in, add/share recipes and save recipes private to themselves for a meal plan.<br>
The Recipe API will be created using the NodeJS runtime and the ExpressJS framework.<br>
The web client uses this API to authenticate into and access the database that is hosted on MongoDB Atlas.<br>
Both The frontend React App and the backend NodeJS REST API will be deployed on Render.<br>
Users can access the App concurrently from anywhere in the world.<br>
