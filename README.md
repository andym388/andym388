### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page 👋

I am a software development enthusiast who continously upgrade my home computer hardware, O/S and networking environment for experimentation with virtualisation, networking, security, databases and software development so as to be proficient on latest technology trends for improving business outcomes.<br>
My current determination is to be able to act as the web and cloud transformation Advocate in the migration and digital transformation projects.<br>

Currently, I am focusing on acquiring the above skillsets.
- 🤞 In the 1st 6-12 months, I have acquired a basic understanding of the skill requirements to be a web developer using tutorials and projects available from YouTube.
- ⚗️ In the coming 6-12 months, I wiil delve into more Advanced topics and build projects with Redux, React Router and Material UI. The aim is to be able to develop  Cloud-based Microservices App using NodeJS, React and Docker. I will also be researching into Python Automation using OpenAI/ChatGPT and AI assisted coding in Visual Studio Code.
- ✨ I will showcase my projects and coding journey here in GitHub and it will be accessible from my LinkedIn profile.

<b>⭐ Cooking Recipe Finder</b><br>
Cooking Receipe Finder is a single-page web App that uses the 👉🏼 <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a> to fetch Recipe data.<br>

<b>⭐ Weather Node</b><br>
The React Weather Wizard App above is re-written in Node.js so that we can compare their differences in approach which are:<br>
▶️ Node.js App is a server-side App with access to the O/S, databases, file system and everything else to build a fully-functional App.<br>
▶️ Hence, it needs to be hosted on a full-stack hosting service such as Railway and Render.<br>
▶️ A HTTP request is used to obtain the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap Data Source.<br>
▶️ In contract, the React App is a client-side App that just uses an API call to obtain/display the weather data from/onto the browser.<br>
