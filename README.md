### My Projects ðŸ¤ž

<b>Hello World App</b><br>
The Hello World App is a time-honored tradition and simple exercise in computer programming to get started when learning something new.<br>

Github Site: <a href="https://andym388.github.io/a01_1hello-world/">Hello World Page</a><br>

<b>Team Profile App</b><br>
This simple Team Profile App displays the information about your Team Members such as the name, the job and a photo image.<br>
When your mouse hover over the trash icon, it turns red.<br>
When you click on the trash icon beside each profile, it removes that profile from the list of profiles.<br>
The Team Profile Data is stored as a JSON array having objects, so if you refresh the page, it will get the data back and repopulate the page with the profiles.<br>
Search functionality is also available such that when you type out some Search Characters, it filters and display the matching Names.<br>
